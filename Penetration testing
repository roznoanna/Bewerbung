# Unauthorized penetration testing on individuals without their consent is unethical and illegal in most countries.
# However, security tests (including penetration tests) are often conducted on computer systems, devices, or infrastructure, 
# rather than directly on people. Penetration testing of computer systems, especially for testing purposes, should only 
# occur with the system owner's consent and in full compliance with the law.
